# Ardān

"Caucasian Albania (Middle Persian: Arān, Ardān, Armenian: Ałuank) was a kingdom in the Caucasus, which was under the suzerainty of the Sasanian Empire from 252 to 636." [1]

WARNING: The Romans overloaded the regional names "Iberia" (in this case referring to Kartli) and "Albania" (in this case referring to Ardān) to refer to various places. This redundancy implies no ethinic or other connection between the peoples in these various locations (e.g. modern Iberia or Albania). Another example of this redundancy is Spanish Galicia and Polish/Ukrainian Galicia. In the latter case they may have been loosely referring to Celtic populations in both regions (cf. modern "Gael"). "Albania" may refer to hilly or rugged country (cf. modern "alpine").

"In 252/3 Ardān, along with Kartli and Armenia, was conquered and annexed by the Sasanian king Shapur I (r. 240–270). Ardān retained its monarchy, although the king had no real power and most civil, religious, and military authority lay with the Sasanian marzban ("margrave") of the territory. In 297 the Treaty of Nisibis stipulated the reestablishment of the Roman protectorate over Kartli, but Ardān remained an integral part of the Sasanian Empire." [1]
