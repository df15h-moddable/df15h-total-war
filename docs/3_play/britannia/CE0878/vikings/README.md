# Vikings

"From 865, the Viking attitude towards the British Isles changed, as they began to see it as a place for potential colonisation rather than simply a place to raid. As a result of this, larger armies began arriving on Britain's shores, with the intention of conquering land and constructing settlements there." [5]

"Viking armies captured York, the major city in the Kingdom of Northumbria, in 866." [5]

# Great Viking Army

aka Danelaw, aka Dana Lag.

## East Engle

aka Gudthormir's (aka Guthrum, aka Æthelstan) Rikit.

"The Kingdom of the East Angles (Old English: Ēastengla Rīċe) was a small independent kingdom comprising what are now the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk and perhaps the eastern part of the Fens. The kingdom formed in the 6th century in the wake of the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain.... It was conquered by the Danes in 869, to form part of the Danelaw." [1]

## Jorvik (Northymbre)

aka York, aka Viking Northymbre.

"York was captured in 866 by Ivar Ragnarsson (the Boneless), leading a large army of Danish vikings which had landed in East Anglia and made their way north. They were aided by internal strife between Anglo-Saxon candidates for the throne of Northumbria. Declaring a truce, the rivals joined forces but failed to retake York in March 867. With their deaths, Deira came under Danish control as the Kingdom of Northumbria. The Anglo-Saxon royal court fled north to refuge in Bernicia." [3]

# Viking Sea Kings

aka Sækonungar

## Dyflin

"Vikings invaded the territory around Dublin in the 9th century, establishing the Norse Kingdom of Dublin, the earliest and longest-lasting Norse kingdom in Ireland. Its territory corresponded to most of present-day County Dublin. The Norse referred to the kingdom as Dyflin, which is derived from Irish Dubh Linn 'black pool'." [4]

"The first reference to the Vikings comes from the Annals of Ulster where the first entry for 841 AD reads: "Pagans still on Lough Neagh". It is from this date onward that historians get references to ship fortresses or longphorts being established in Ireland. It may be safe to assume that the Vikings first over-wintered in 840–841 AD." [4]

"Norse rulers of Dublin were often co-kings, and occasionally also Kings of Jórvík in what is now Yorkshire. Under their rule, Dublin became the biggest slave port in Western Europe." [4]

## Suðreyar

"The Kingdom of the Isles consisted of the Isle of Man, the Hebrides and the islands of the Firth of Clyde from the 9th to the 13th centuries AD. The islands were known to the Norse as the Suðreyjar, or "Southern Isles" as distinct from the Norðreyjar or Northern Isles of Orkney and Shetland." [1]

"Viking influence in the area commenced in the late 8th century." [1] "In 870 Dumbarton was besieged by Amlaíb Conung and Ímar, "the two kings of the Northmen", who "returned to Dublin from Britain" the following year with numerous captives. It is therefore likely that Scandinavian hegemony was already significant on the western coasts of Scotland by then." [1]
