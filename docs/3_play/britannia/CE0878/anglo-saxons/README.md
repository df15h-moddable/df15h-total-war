# Anglo-Saxons

"The Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain is the process which changed the language and culture of most of what became England from Romano-British to Germanic. The Germanic-speakers in Britain, themselves of diverse origins, eventually developed a common cultural identity as Anglo-Saxons. This process principally occurred from the mid-fifth to early seventh centuries, following the end of Roman rule in Britain around the year 410. The settlement was followed by the establishment of the Heptarchy, Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in the south and east of Britain, later followed by the rest of modern England, and the south-east of modern Scotland." [4]

"By the mid-ninth century, Anglo-Saxon England comprised four separate and independent kingdoms: East Anglia, Wessex, Northumbria, and Mercia, the last of which was the strongest military power." [5]

# Kingdoms

aka Angelþéod (Old English, "the English people").

There were four significant Anglo-Saxon kingdoms: East Anglia, Mercia, Northumbria, and Wessex.
Keep in mind that in 878 the Danelaw covered all of East Anglia, as well as half each of Mercia and Northumbria.

## Mierce

aka Mercia.

"It was centred around the River Trent and its tributaries, in a region now known as the Midlands of England." [2]

"A Latinisation of an Old English word derived from the Mercian dialect, Merce, meaning "borderland"
(from which the Modern English word march also comes),
the kingdom was rendered as Mierce or Myrce in the West Saxon dialect." [2]

## Nordhanhymbra

aka Northumbria.

"The name derives from the Old English Norþanhymbre meaning 'the people or province north of the Humber'." [1]

## West Seaxe

aka Westseaxna, aka Wessex.
